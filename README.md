Learning github

About Me:

I've been programming on and off for a few years. My first experience was during my undergrad research in computational chemistry. Most recently I was able to use what I learned to streamline data input and analysis for a chemistry lab I helped start up. I haven't colloabrated with anyone before so github is new to me. I'm excited to learn new tricks and grow as a programmer.

I have the most experience with Python which I started learning in early 2020 to automate processes for work. Right now I'm learning Django so I can build my first website. I've taken courses in Javascript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I used Fortran and wrote some bash scripts during my undergrad research which was completed in 2016. I'm currently trying to learn full-time in hopes of making a carrer transition.
