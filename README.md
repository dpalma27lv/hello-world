Learning github

About Me:

I've been programming on and off for a few years. My first experience was during my undergrad research in computational chemistry. Most recently I was able to use what I learned to streamline data input and analysis for a chemistry lab I helped start up. I haven't colloabrated with anyone before so github is new to me.
